# GitHub Pages Configuration for Twitch Embeds

# This file should be placed in the root of your repository
# to help with iframe embedding

# Custom domain configuration (optional)
# If you have a custom domain, it may work better than github.io

# For GitHub Pages with custom domain:
# 1. Set up custom domain in repository settings
# 2. Update CNAME file with your domain
# 3. Use your domain as parent parameter

# Alternative: Use gh-pages branch deployment
# This sometimes has better CSP compatibility

# Build and deploy script:
# npm run build
# npx gh-pages -d dist
